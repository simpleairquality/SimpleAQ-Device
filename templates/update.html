<b>Your settings have been applied and this device is rebooting.</b>
<p/>
The SimpleAQ device will only present its network if it is unable to connect to the local wifi or to the SimpleAQ service for any reason.<br/>
If you don't see the SimpleAQ wifi network come back up, it's probably because you've configured the device correctly and it is working!
