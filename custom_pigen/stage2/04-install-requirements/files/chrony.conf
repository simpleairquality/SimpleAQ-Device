# Set the initial step/slew policy. This directive is CRITICAL for system stability.
# makestep 1 3: Step the clock immediately (unsafe jump) IF the adjustment is 
# larger than 1 second, BUT ONLY during the first 3 updates after startup.
# After that, it ONLY USES SAFE SLEWING. This prevents the large jumps that 
# caused your system services (like journald) to fail.

# Synchronise the hardware Real Time Clock (RTC) with the system clock.
# If your device has an RTC, this ensures the time is retained across power loss.

# --- GPSD Reference Clock Configuration ---
# 
# The refclock directive tells chrony to read time from a hardware reference source.
# 
# SHM 0: GPS Time (NMEA data) via Shared Memory. This provides the date and time.

# Use the NTP pool for your region or specific servers as a fallback.
